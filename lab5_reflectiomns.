What I have learned: Iâ€™ve gained practical experience in setting up an MQTT client on the ESP32, including how to establish Wi-Fi connections and publish messages to a broker. This hands-on project enhanced my understanding of IoT communication protocols.

What I believe I need to improve: I need to improve my debugging skills, particularly in identifying and resolving issues that arise during coding and hardware setup. More familiarity with common error messages would also be beneficial.

What the teacher could have said or done to make learning easier: The teacher could have provided more guided examples and troubleshooting tips throughout the project. A live demo showing the process step-by-step might have clarified some concepts and common pitfalls.

What I could have done to make the learning easier: I could have taken more initiative to practice coding outside of class and sought additional resources or tutorials to supplement my understanding of MQTT and the ESP32.

Other reflections: This experience highlighted the importance of perseverance and collaboration in learning technical subjects. Engaging with peers for discussions and support can enhance understanding and retention of complex concepts.
